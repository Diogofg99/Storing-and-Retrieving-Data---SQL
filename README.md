Create a fictitious online shop of products or services. 
Design and create an ERD in MySQL workbench for a small online shop of any products and/or services. 

Create two triggers: (1) one that updates the stock of products after the customer completes an order. And (2) a trigger that inserts a row in a “log” table if the price of a product is updated.

Your online shop just acquired a small shop in a similar line of business that was near to bankruptcy.
The old shop was not online and managed the customers in an excel table. You need to adjust your ERD to add these customers to make a promotional campaign for them. 

Create a physical relational database based on your ERD.

Insert some data into you newly created database.

Using MySQL, write que queries to retrieve the following information:

1. List all the customer’s names, dates, and products or services bought by these customers in a
range of two dates.
2. List the best three customers (you are free to select the criteria that define a “best customer”)
3. Get the average amount of sales (in euros) by month and by year for the whole sales history.
4. Get the total sales by geographical location (city/country).
5. List all the locations where products/services where sold and the product has customer’s ratings.

Create two views to recreate the information on the INVOICE (one for the head and totals, and another for the details).
